  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p>My name is Joao, I am 34 years old, was born in a city in the country side of Brazil, called Colatina and grew up in Sao Paulo.</p>
  <p>I love sports, specifically weight lifting and running. As a brazilian, I still love soccer, even after getting destroyed by Germany during last World Cup at home. I support Flamengo and hopefully we will win our 7th League this year.</p>
  <h1>Education</h1>
  <p>I am graduated in Mechanical Engineering, and worked in the Aviation Industry during four years, when I decided to change my life a little bit and dive into the Music Industry.</p>
  <p>I moved to London in 2007, when I started an Audio Engineering course which got me started in the music business.</p>
  <p>After two years living in London, went back to Brazil, and as things did not go the way I wanted, I decided to go back to Engineering, but, focusing on IT.</p>
  <p>I did an iOS development course back in 2013, and since then I have been studiyng and programming iOS apps.</p>
  <p>After pretty much one year, studying I received a job offer to work for Ford Motor Company, helping developers to integrate their apps to Ford Vehicles, which are controlled via voice commands. I pretty much studied Ford's API and helped any developer who wanted their app in the car with this integration.</p>
  <p>After that, I decided to come to Codefellows for the iOS Accelerator, and learn Web Development as well, which I always wanted to.</p>
  <p>At the moment, I am loving it, the environment, instructors, TAs and all classmates. Everyone is really into it, and helping each other.</p>
